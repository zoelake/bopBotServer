## bopBot Server Side Application
The bopBot Server Side Application is an essential component of the [bopBot](https://github.com/zoelake/bopBot) project. Hosted on Cyclic, it serves as essential middleware to handle all of our CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations in tandem with the bopBot database on MongoDB. This setup enables bopBot to be deployed and run remotely without relying on a local host!
